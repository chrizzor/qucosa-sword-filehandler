                    </mods:titleInfo>
                    <mods:abstract lang="eng" type="content">Since Quantum Choromdynamics allows for gluon
                        self-coupling, quarks and gluons cannot be observed as free particles, but only their bound
                        states, the hadrons. This so-called confinement phenomenon is responsible for 98% of the mass in
                        the visible universe. The measurement of the hadron excitation spectra therefore gives valuable
                        input for theory and phenomenology to quantitatively understand this phenomenon. One simple
                        model to describe hadrons is the Constituent Quark Model (CQM), which knows two types of
                        hadrons: mesons, consisting of a quark and an antiquark, and baryons, which are made out of
                        three quarks. More advanced models, which are inspired by QCD as well as calculations within
                        Lattice QCD predict the existence of other types of hadrons, which may be e.g. described solely
                        by gluonic excitations (glueballs) or mixed quark and gluon excitations (hybrids). In order to
                        search for such states, the COMPASS experiment at the Super Proton Synchrotron at CERN has
                        collected large data sets, which allow to study the light-quark meson and baryon spectra in
                        unmatched precision. The overview shown here focuses on the light meson sector, presenting a
                        detailed Partial-Wave Analysis of the processes: π−p→π−π+π−p and π−p→π−π0π0p. A new state, the
                        a1(1420) with JPC=1++ is observed. Its Breit-Wigner parameters are found to be in the ranges:
                        m=1412−1422MeV/c2 and Γ=130−150MeV/c2. In the same analysis, a signal in a wave with JPC=1−+ is
                        observed. A resonant origin of this signal would not be explicable within the CQM. In addition
                        to this possibility of an exotic state, a possible non resonant origin of this signal is
                        discussed.
